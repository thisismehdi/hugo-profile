         I developed a responsive web application using Java and Angular to compare product prices across various online retailers. 
         I implemented web scraping algorithms to gather real-time pricing data from multiple e-commerce platforms. Additionally, 
         I created a user-friendly interface that allows easy product search and comparison. To enhance user experience, I integrated data analysis tools to provide insights on price trends and best deal recommendations.

          I contributed to the development of a secure online examination platform using Django and Face-api.js, 
          incorporating facial recognition technology. I implemented backend logic for user authentication and exam session management.
